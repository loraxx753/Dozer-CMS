## A Little About Me

My name is Kevin Baugh, and I make things work. I love playing around in programming to see what can be done with it. I'm current living in Orlando, Florida with [my dog Onyon](http://imgur.com/smjt3BI.png).

This page really serves as a way to get to know me and the work that I can do. I'm fairly fluent with PHP, JavaScript, Python and a lot of their various flavors (CoffeeScript, jQuery, FuelPHP, CodeIgnightor, Django), although I know there's a lot more to learn.
